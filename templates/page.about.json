Hand-spun silks from Japan, bentwood furniture from Austria, and glassware from Sweden. With his catalogue and range expanding, he soon started manufacturing locally – including his own furniture range.With no children to join the business, his nephew Robert Macfarlane emigrated from Calander in Scotland to grow the business, and the stores were managed by generations of the Macfarlane family up until the 1980s. In 2017, Ian Macfarlane and his partner Susie Wall launched a new furniture company inspired by their entrepreneurial ancestor. Today, the reborn James Stewart brand is known for enduring, collectible furniture, driven by the belief that good design should be made to last.</p>",
